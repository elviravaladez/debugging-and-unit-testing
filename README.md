## Overview

### The Objective

Understand the fundamentals of debugging and Unit Testing in Java.

## My Process

### Built With

- Java
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea.html) Debugger
- JUnit

### What I Learned

This section will be updated to include some of my major learnings while working through this project.

I will be writing these out and providing code samples of areas I would like to highlight to reinforce my knowledge.

When major learnings are shared, they will look similar to the code snippets below ðŸ˜Š:


```java
public class com.timbuchalka.Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

This section will outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects.
